# Controls

This module provides a datatype controls that represent key or joypad buttons / axis bindings. Controls can be seen as an abstraction of the [inputs](./inputs.md) and the [joypad](./joypad.md).

Controls are like a virtual game device that provides buttons and axes abstracted away from the actual input devices that the user is interacting with. Of course, these virtual commands and axes are mapped to real, low-level inputs from the keyboard and/or the joypad.

You script can control which keyboard and joypad inputs are associated to each controls command or axes.

## Overview

### Commands

Commands are the "buttons" of Solarus' virtual controls.

| Command    | Role                                                                                                               |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `"action"` | Contextual action such as talking, swimming, throwing, etc                                                         |
| `"attack"` | Main attack (using the sword)                                                                                      |
| `"pause"`  | Pausing or unpausing the game                                                                                      |
| `"item_1"` | Using the equipment item placed in slot 1 (see [`game:get_item_assigned()`](../game.md#gameget_item_assignedslot)) |
| `"item_2"` | Using the equipment item placed in slot 2 (see [`game:get_item_assigned()`](../game.md#gameget_item_assignedslot)) |
| `"right"`  | Moving to the right.                                                                                               |
| `"left"`   | Moving to the left.                                                                                                |
| `"up"`     | Moving to the top.                                                                                                 |
| `"down"`   | Moving to the bottom.                                                                                              |

When a game command is pressed, no matter if the command came from the keyboard or the joypad, the engine performs some built-in behavior by default (like pausing the game or moving the hero to the right).

But you can also extend or override this behavior, because the engine notifies you first (see [`game:on_command_pressed()`]). Therefore, you usually don't have to worry about the underlying keyboard or joypad input (but if you want to you can as the game object is an [input](./inputs.md#events-of-input-handlers).)

### Axes

Axes are used by the engine only for movements of the hero.

| Name  | Role            |
| ----- | --------------- |
| `"X"` | Horizontal axis |
| `"Y"` | Vertical axis   |

### Extending

Every method or function accepting commands or axes names actually accept any string and will happily register / propagate the custom name you provided. This permits you extend over the default commands and axes that the engine uses.

For example, you could bind additional axes of the [joypad](./joypad.md) instances to custom functionalities while keeping the controls abstraction which would allow users with a keyboard to also profit from your game.

## Functions of `sol.controls`

### `sol.controls.create_from_keyboard()`

Creates the controls using the default mapping for the keyboard. Default mappings are:

| Key                                                 | Role       |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| <kbd>←</kbd> <kbd>↑</kbd> <kbd>→</kbd> <kbd>↓</kbd> | Directions |
| <kbd>Space</kbd>                                    | Action     |
| <kbd>C</kbd>                                        | Attack     |
| <kbd>X</kbd>                                        | Item1      |
| <kbd>V</kbd>                                        | Item2      |
| <kbd>D</kbd>                                        | Pause      |

Axes are mapped to their corresponding directions.

Return value (controls)
: `controls` The controls object created.

### `sol.controls.create_from_joypad(joypad)`

Creates the controls using the default mapping for a joypad instance. Those contols respond only to the given joypad.

Default mappings are:

| Button       | Role       |

| A            | Attack     |
| B            | Action     |
| X            | Item1      |
| Y            | Item2      |
| Start        | Pause      |
| Left Stick X | X          |
| Left Stick Y | Y          |
