# Map

Maps are areas where the [game](./game.md) takes place. They may be rooms, houses, entire dungeon floors, parts of the outside world or any place. The active map contains many objects called [map entities](./map-entities/index.md) (or just "entities" to be short). Map entities are everything that has a position on the map, including the [hero](./map-entities/hero.md), the [tiles](./map-entities/tile.md), the [enemies](./map-entities/enemy.md), the [pickable treasures](./map-entities/pickable.md) and even the [camera](./map-entities/camera.md). See the [entity API](./map-entities/index.md) for more details.

## Overview

### Coordinates and layer

A map has a rectangular size in pixels. The width and the height are always multiples of 8 pixels, and most [map entities](./map-entities/index.md) usually stay aligned on a grid of squares of 8x8 pixels (except when they are moving).

Thus, each [entity](./map-entities/index.md) has some coordinates `X,Y` on the map. But its position is also defined by a third value: its layer. The map has a number of distinct layers that are stacked. Each layer has its own list of entities. Layers are identified by a number. There is always a layer `0`, and maps can add additional layers above or below `0`

Layers allow to implement maps with multi-level content, like a bridge between two higher platforms. The [hero](./map-entities/hero.md) (as well as [enemies](./map-entities/enemy.md) and any other [map entity](./map-entities/index.md)) is then able to walk either above or under the bridge, depending on his layer. Entities like [stairs](./map-entities/stairs.md) and [jumpers](./map-entities/jumper.md) can change the layer of the hero automatically, but you can also do that from your Lua scripts.

### Tileset

The graphic skin of a map is called a [tileset](../files-specs/tileset-data-file.md). The tileset defines the small patterns used to draw [tiles](./map-entities/tile.md) and also some other [entities](./map-entities/index.md) that may depend on the skin. For example, you can have a forest tileset, a castle tileset, etc. Tilesets have no special size limitation. It is possible to use multiple tilesets in the same map.

### Map files

A map can contain many types of [entities](./map-entities/index.md). Map entities can be either declared in the map data file or created dynamically. Thus, a map with id `XXXX` is managed by two distinct files:

- In the data file `maps/XXXX.dat` are declared all entities that initially compose your map (most importantly: the [tiles](./map-entities/tile.md)). You normally don't need to edit this file by hand: you can use Solarus Editor (but if you want to, [here is the syntax](../files-specs/map-data-file.md)).

- In the script file `"maps/XXXX.lua"` (which is optional), you define the dynamic behavior of your map, using the features of the `map` Lua type described on this page (and the rest of the Solarus API will also be very useful).

When the player enters a map, the engine first creates the [entities](./map-entities/index.md) declared in the map data file [maps/XXXX.dat](../files-specs/map-data-file.md), and then it runs your script `"maps/XXXX.lua"` The Lua map object is passed as parameter of your script (remember that any Lua script is implicitly a function and can have parameters). Use the Lua notation `...` to get this parameter and store it into a regular variable.

Here is a basic example of script for a map that does nothing special except playing a special music and showing an evil welcome dialog when the hero enters it.

```lua
-- First, we put the parameter into a variable called "map".
-- (In Lua, the notation "..." refers to the parameter(s) of the script.)
local map = ...
local game = map:get_game()

-- Event called when the player enters the map, at initialization time.
function map:on_started()

  -- Play an evil music.
  sol.audio.play_music("evil")
end

-- Event called when the player takes control, after the opening transition.
function map:on_opening_transition_finished()

  -- Show an evil welcome dialog.
  game:start_dialog("welcome_to_darkness")
end
```

In practice, many maps have short scripts like this or even no script at all. Sometimes, everything that you define in the data file (with the help of Solarus Editor) is enough. You need a script when there is something dynamic to program on your map: opening a [door](./map-entities/door.md) when a [pressure plate](./map-entities/switch.md) is pressed, making a [treasure chest](./map-entities/chest.md) appear when some [enemies](./map-entities/enemy.md) are killed, showing a dialog with an [NPC](./map-entities/npc.md) that depends on whether the player has accomplished a particular action before, etc.

### Lifetime of maps

At any moment, during the [game](./game.md), only one map is active: the one drawn on the game screen. That map is also the one where the [hero](./map-entities/hero.md) is currently located. Only the active map has its entities living in it. Other maps are not loaded. If the player leaves the map and comes back later, your Lua map object will be a new one the second time. Your entities will be reloaded as specified in the [map data file](../files-specs/map-data-file.md) and your map script will be executed again.

If you want some data or behavior to persist when the player comes back, like the position of an [NPC](./map-entities/npc.md) or whether a puzzle was solved, you can store the information into the [savegame](./game.md#gameset_valuesavegame_variable-value). Alternatively, if you don't want these data to be saved, but you want to remember then during the current [game](./game.md) session, you can store the information as a field of the [game](./game.md) object. The game object persists until the player stops playing and comes back to the title screen or restarts the game.

!!! note "Note"

    Some entities save their state automatically if you want, like whether a [treasure chest](./map-entities/chest.md) is open, whether a [door](./map-entities/door.md) is open or whether an [enemy](./map-entities/enemy.md) is killed. Therefore, you have nothing to do for such entities: they keep their state.

### Accessing maps like tables

Like other essential Solarus types (including [game](./game.md), [items](./equipment-items.md) and [map entities](./map-entities/index.md)), a fundamental property of maps is that even if they are userdata, they can also be used like Lua tables.

This property is actually what allows you to define events on your map. But you can store any data in your map object, including new functions specific to your particular map. Here is an example that uses this feature:

```lua
-- Example of a map with 3 switches to activate in the correct order.
-- We assume that 3 switches exist with names "puzzle_switch_1", "puzzle_switch_2" and "puzzle_switch_3".
local map = ...
local game = map:get_game()

function map:on_started()
  map.next_switch_index = 1
  -- Equivalent to: map["next_switch_index"] = 1
end

-- Called when the player walks on the switch named "puzzle_switch_1".
function puzzle_switch_1:on_activated()
  -- Check that puzzle_switch_1 is the correct switch to activate.
  map:check_switch(self)
end

function puzzle_switch_2:on_activated()
  map:check_switch(self)
end

function puzzle_switch_3:on_activated()
  map:check_switch(self)
end

function map:check_switch(switch)
  if switch:get_name() == "puzzle_switch_" .. map.next_switch_index then
    -- Okay so far.
    map.next_switch_index = map.next_switch_index + 1
    if map.next_switch_index > 3 then
      -- Finished!
      sol.audio.play_sound("secret")
      game:start_dialog("congratulations")
    end
  else
    -- Wrong switch: reset the puzzle.
    sol.audio.play_sound("wrong")
    puzzle_switch_1:set_activated(false)
    puzzle_switch_2:set_activated(false)
    puzzle_switch_3:set_activated(false)
    map.next_switch_index = 1
  end
end
```

In this example, you see that we add three values to the map object, like if it was a table: `next_switch_index` (a number), `on_started` (a function) and `check_switch` (a function). Actually, we also use this feature on the three switches as well: we add a value `on_activated` on them.

!!! note "Note"

    You may wonder how we can access `puzzle_switch_1`,`puzzle_switch_2`and `puzzle_switch_3` without declaring them. There is a mechanism that makes all named [map entities](./map-entities/index.md) directly accessible in the environment of the map script. See [`map:get_entity()`](#mapget_entityname) for more details. But this example has some issues. The three [switches](./map-entities/switch.md) are managed by duplicated code. This is error-prone because one day, we will probably want to make a similar puzzle with 50 entities instead of just 3. To make your map easier to maintain, the following and equivalent version is much more preferred:

    ```lua
    local map = ...
    local game = map:get_game()

    function map:on_started()
      map.next_switch_index = 1
      map.nb_switches = map:get_entities_count("puzzle_switch_")
    end

    local function puzzle_switch_activated(switch)
      map:check_switch(switch)
    end

    -- Define the same on_activated() method for all entities whose name
    -- starts with "puzzle_switch_".
    for switch in map:get_entities("puzzle_switch_") do
      switch.on_activated = puzzle_switch_activated
    end

    function map:check_switch(switch)
      if switch:get_name() == "puzzle_switch_" .. map.next_switch_index then
        -- Okay so far.
        map.next_switch_index = map.next_switch_index + 1
        if map.next_switch_index > map.nb_switches then
          -- Finished!
          sol.audio.play_sound("secret")
          game:start_dialog("congratulations")
        end
      else
        -- Wrong switch: reset the puzzle.
        sol.audio.play_sound("wrong")
        for s in map:get_entities("puzzle_switch_") do
          s:set_activated(false)
        end
        map.next_switch_index = 1
      end
    end
    ```

    This improved version is more evolutive: it does not even hardcode the number of [switches](./map-entities/switch.md) in the puzzle. Thus, if you add a switch called `"puzzle_switch_4"` from Solarus Editor one day, you won't even have to change your scripts: it will directly take it into account in the puzzle.

## Methods of the type `map`

### `map:get_id()`

Returns the id of this map.

Return value (string)
: Id of the map.

!!! note "Note"

    This id appears in the name of [map files](#map-files).

### `map:get_game()`

Returns the current game.

Return value ([game](./game.md))
: The game that is currently running the map.

### `map:get_world()`

Returns the world name that was set on this map.

The world name is an optional property defined in the [map data file](#map-files). Worlds allow to group maps together. The world can be any arbitrary name. Maps that have the same world name are considered to be part of the same environment. For example, your map can be in a world named `"outside_world"`,`"dungeon_1"` or `"some_scary_cave"` A map that has no world is always considered to be alone in its own environment.

The world property is used to decide when to set the starting location of the player (the place where he starts when loading his [savegame](./game.md)). By default, the starting location is automatically set by the engine when the world changes (not when the map changes). This can be changed by defining the "Save starting location" property of destinations, from Solarus Editor or from a script (with [`destination:set_starting_location_mode()`](./map-entities/destination.md#destinationset_starting_location_modemode)).

Some other features may also rely on the world property, like the state of [crystal blocks](./map-entities/crystal-block.md). Their state persists between all maps of the current world and is reset when entering a map whose world is different.

Return value (string)
: Name of the world of the current map. `nil` means no world.

### `map:set_world(world)`

Changes the world of this map.

The world property remains until the map is destroyed: If you reload the same map again later, the world is reset to the one defined in the [map data file](#map-files).

`world` (string)
: The new world name to set, or `nil` to set no world.

### `map:get_floor()`

Returns the floor of the current map if any.

The floor is an optional property defined in the [map data file](#map-files).

The engine does not do anything particular with this floor property. But you can use it in scripts, for example to show the current floor on the HUD when it changes or to make a minimap [menu](./menus.md).

Return value (number)
: The current floor. `0` is the first floor, `1` is the second floor, `-1` is the first basement floor, etc. `nil` means that this map is not part of a floor system.

### `map:set_floor(floor)`

Changes the floor of this map.

The floor property remains until the map is destroyed: If you reload the same map again later, the floor is reset to the one defined in the [map data file](#map-files).

`floor` (number)
: The new floor number to set, or `nil` to set no floor.

### `map:get_min_layer()`

Returns the index of the lowest layer of this map.

Return value (number)
: The lowest layer (0 or less).

### `map:get_max_layer()`

Returns the index of the highest layer of this map.

Return value (number)
: The highest layer (0 or more).

### `map:get_size()`

Returns the size of this map in pixels.

Return value 1 (number)
: The width in pixels (always a multiple of 8).

Return value 2 (number)
: The height in pixels (always a multiple of 8).

### `map:get_location()`

Returns the x,y location of this map in its [world](#mapget_world).

The engine uses this information to implement scrolling between two adjacent maps.

For example, you can also use this property in scripts if you want to show the position of the hero on the minimap [menu](./menus.md) of your outside [world](#mapget_world). Indeed, your outside world is probably not a single map, but it is usually composed of several adjacent maps.

Return value 1 (number)
: X position of the top-left corner of this map relative to its world.

Return value 2 (number)
: Y position of the top-left corner of this map relative to its world.

### `map:get_tileset()`

Returns the name of the [tileset](#tileset) of the current map.

Return value (string)
: Id of the current tileset.

### `map:set_tileset(tileset_id)`

Changes the [tileset](#tileset) of the current map.

It is your responsability to make sure that the new tileset is be compatible with the previous one: every tile of the previous tileset must exist in the new one and have the exact same properties, and only the images can differ.

`tileset_id` (string)
: Id of the new tileset to set.

!!! note "Note"

    If the new tileset is not compatible with the previous one, tiles will be displayed with wrong graphics.

### `map:get_music()`

Returns the name of the music associated to this map.

This is the music to play when the map starts, as specified in the map file. It may be different from the music currently being played. To get the music currently being played, see [`sol.audio.get_music()`](./audio/index.md#solaudioplay_musicmusic_id-action).

Return value (string)
: Name of the music of this map, relative to the `musics` directory and without extension. It can also be the special value `"same"` if the map specifies to keep the music unchanged, or `nil` if the map specifies to play no music.

### `map:get_camera()`

Returns the main camera entity of the map.

Return value ([camera](./map-entities/camera.md))
: The main camera.

### `map:get_cameras()`

Returns all the camera entities of the map. By default, each camera is tracking a specific hero.
See [map:get_heroes](./map.md/#mapget_heroes).

Return value (function)
: An iterator to all camera entities of the map.

### `map:get_ground(x, y, layer)`

Returns the kind of ground (terrain) of a point.

The ground is defined by [tiles](./map-entities/tile.md) (and other entities that may change it like [dynamic tiles](./map-entities/dynamic-tile.md)) that overlap this point.

`x` (number)
: X coordinate of a point of the map.

`y` (number)
: Y coordinate of a point of the map.

`layer` (number)
: The layer, between [`map:get_min_layer()`](#mapget_min_layer) and [`map:get_max_layer()`](#mapget_max_layer).

Return value (string)
: The kind of ground. The possible values are the same as the `ground` property of the [tileset file](../files-specs/tileset-data-file.md): `"empty"`, `"traversable"`, `"wall"`, `"low_wall"`, `"wall_top_right"`, `"wall_top_left"`, `"wall_bottom_left"`, `"wall_bottom_right"`, `"wall_top_right_water"`, `"wall_top_left_water"`, `"wall_bottom_left_water"`, `"wall_bottom_right_water"`, `"deep_water"`, `"shallow_water"`, `"grass"`, `"hole"`, `"ice"`, `"ladder"`, `"prickles"` or `"lava"`

### `map:draw_visual(drawable, x, y)`

Draws a [drawable object](./drawable-objects/index.md) ([surface](./drawable-objects/surface.md), [text surface](./drawable-objects/text-surface.md) or [sprite](./drawable-objects/sprite.md)) on the [camera](#mapget_camera) at the given map coordinates.

This function can be used as an alternative to [`drawable:draw()`](./drawable-objects/index.md#drawabledrawdst_surface-x-y) in order to draw the object relative to the map (instead of relative to the screen).

If the object to draw is a [sprite](./drawable-objects/sprite.md), its origin point will be displayed at the given location, relative to the the upper left corner of the map.

This function should only be called during the drawing phase of the map, for example from [`map:on_draw()`](#mapon_drawcamera_surface) or from [`custom_entity:on_post_draw()`](./map-entities/index.md#entityon_post_drawcamera).

`drawable` ([drawable](./drawable-objects/index.md))
: The visual object to draw on the map.

`x` (number)
: X coordinate of where to draw the object, in map coordinates.

`y` (number)
: Y coordinate of where to draw the object, in map coordinates.

### `map:draw_sprite(sprite, x, y)`

Draws a [sprite](./drawable-objects/sprite.md) on the screen at the given map coordinates.

!!! warning "Deprecated"

    This method is deprecated since Solarus 1.5. Use [`map:draw_visual()`](#mapdraw_visualdrawable-x-y) instead.

### `map:get_crystal_state()`

Returns the configuration of [crystal blocks](./map-entities/crystal-block.md).

Return value (boolean)
: `false` initially (orange blocks lowered), `true` otherwise (blue blocks lowered).

### `map:set_crystal_state(state)`

Sets the configuration of [crystal blocks](./map-entities/crystal-block.md).

This state persists accross maps of the same [world](#mapget_world). It is reset when the world changes and when the [savegame](./game.md) is reloaded.

`state` (boolean)
: `false` to set the initial configuration (orange blocks lowered), `true` to the modified one (blue blocks lowered).

### `map:change_crystal_state()`

Inverts the configuration of [crystal blocks](./map-entities/crystal-block.md).

!!! note "Note"

    Equivalent to `map:set_crystal_state(not map:get_crystal_state())`.

### `map:open_doors(prefix)`

Opens the [doors](./map-entities/door.md) whose name starts with the specified prefix, enables or disables relative [dynamic tiles](./map-entities/dynamic-tile.md) accordingly and plays the `"door_open"` [sound](./audio/index.md#solaudioplay_soundsound_id).

Opening a door may be more complex than just modifying a single [door entity](./map-entities/door.md). Indeed, there is often a corresponding door is the adjacent room that you also want to open (that corresponding door is another [entity](./map-entities/index.md)). Name both doors with the same prefix, and you can use this function to open both of them.

Furthermore, you sometimes want [dynamic tiles](./map-entities/dynamic-tile.md) to be shown or hidden depending on the state of a door. When a door is open, all dynamic tiles whose prefix is the door's name followed by `_open` or `_closed` are automatically enabled or disabled, respectively.

`prefix` (string)
: Prefix of the name of doors to open.

!!! note "Note"

    The doors will be really closed once the opening animation of their sprite is finished. However, they immediately become obstacles.

### `map:close_doors(prefix)`

Closes the [doors](./map-entities/door.md) whose name starts with the specified prefix, enables or disables relative [dynamic tiles](./map-entities/dynamic-tile.md) accordingly and plays the `"door_closed"` [sound](./audio/index.md#solaudioplay_soundsound_id).

Closing a door may be more complex than just modifying a single [door entity](./map-entities/door.md). Indeed, there is often a corresponding door is the adjacent room that you also want to open (that corresponding door is another [entity](./map-entities/index.md)). Name both doors with the same prefix, and you can use this function to close both of them.

Furthermore, you sometimes want [dynamic tiles](./map-entities/dynamic-tile.md) to be shown or hidden depending on the state of a door. When a door is closed, all dynamic tiles whose prefix is the door's name followed by `_open` or `_closed` are automatically disabled or enabled, respectively.

`prefix` (string)
: Prefix of the name of doors to close.

### `map:set_doors_open(prefix, [open])`

Like [`map:open_doors()`](#mapopen_doorsprefix) or [`map:close_doors()`](#mapclose_doorsprefix), but does not play any sound or any sprite animation.

This function is intended to be called when you don't want the player to notice the change, typically when your map starts (i.e. from the [`map:on_started()`](#mapon_starteddestination) event).

`prefix` (string)
: Prefix of the name of doors to set.

`open` (boolean, optional)
: `true` to open the doors, `false` to close them (no value means `true`)

### `map:get_entity(name)`

Returns the [map entity](./map-entities/index.md) with the specified name if it exists on this map. Entity names are unique (two entities cannot exist on the map with the same name at the same time). The name is optional: some entities may have no name. In this case, you cannot access them from this function.

As a convenient feature, map entities can also be accessed directly through the environment of the [map script](#map-files). In other words, you can just write `bob:get_position()` as an equivalent to `map:get_entity("bob"):get_position()`.

`name` (string)
: Name of the map entity to get.

Return value ([entity](./map-entities/index.md))
: The corresponding entity, or `nil` if there exists no entity with this name on the map.

!!! note "Note"

    Technical note for curious Lua experts: the mechanism that makes map entities directly accessible in the map script environment is lazy (it is implemented as an `__index` metamethod).

    Entities are imported to the Lua side only when your script requests them. If you have thousands of named entities in your map, you won't have thousands of useless objects living in Lua. Only the ones your script tries to access are imported.

### `map:has_entity(name)`

Returns whether there currently exists a [map entity](./map-entities/index.md) with the specified name on the map.

`name` (string)
: Name of the [map entity](./map-entities/index.md) to check.

Return value (boolean)
: `true` if such an entity exists.

!!! note "Note"

    Equivalent to `map:get_entity(name) ~= nil` (but a bit lighter because it avoids to export the entity to Lua).

### `map:get_entities([prefix])`

Returns an iterator to all [map entities](./map-entities/index.md) whose name has the specified prefix.

The typical usage of this function is:

```lua
for entity in map:get_entities("your_prefix") do
  -- some code related to the entity
end
```

`prefix` (string, optional)
: Prefix of the entities to get. No value means all entities (equivalent to an empty prefix).

Return value (function)
: An iterator to all entities with this prefix. Entities are returned in Z order (insertion order).

### `map:get_entities_count(prefix)`

Returns the number of [map entities](./map-entities/index.md) having the specified prefix.

`prefix` (string)
: Prefix of the entities to count.

Return value (number)
: The number of entities having this prefix on the map.

### `map:has_entities(prefix)`

Returns whether there exists at least one [map entity](./map-entities/index.md) having the specified prefix.

This function can be used for example to checker whether a group of [enemies](./map-entities/enemy.md) is dead.

`prefix` (string)
: Prefix of the entities to check.

Return value (boolean)
: `true` if at least one entity with this prefix exists on the map.

!!! note "Note"

    Equivalent to `map:get_entities_count(prefix) > 0` but faster when there are a lot of entities (because it stops searching as soon as there is a match).

### `map:get_entities_by_type(type)`

Returns an iterator to all [map entities](./map-entities/index.md) of the given type on the map.

The typical usage of this function is:

```lua
for entity in map:get_entities_by_type(type) do
  -- some code related to the entity
end
```

`type` (string)
: Name of an entity type. See [`entity:get_type()`](./map-entities/index.md#entityget_type) for the possible values.

### `map:get_entities_in_rectangle(x, y, width, height)`

Returns an iterator to all [map entities](./map-entities/index.md) whose maximum bounding box intersects the given rectangle. The maximum bounding box is the union of the entity's own [bounding box](./map-entities/index.md#entityget_bounding_box) and of the bounding boxes from its sprites.

The typical usage of this function is:

```lua
for entity in map:get_entities_in_rectangle(x, y, width, height) do
  -- some code related to the entity
end
```

`x` (number)
: X coordinate of the rectangle's upper-left corner.

`y` (number)
: Y coordinate of the rectangle's upper-left corner.

`width` (number)
: Width of the rectangle.

`height` (number)
: Height of the rectangle.

Return value (function)
: An iterator to all entities intersecting the rectangle. Entities are returned in Z order (insertion order).

### `map:get_entities_in_region(x, y), map:get_entities_in_region(entity)`

Returns an iterator to all [map entities](./map-entities/index.md) that are in a region. Regions of the map are defined by the position of [separators](./map-entities/separator.md) and map limits. The region of an entity is the one of its center point.

Regions should be rectangular. Non-convex regions, for example with an "L" shape, are not supported by this function.

The typical usage of this function is:

```lua
for entity in map:get_entities_in_region(my_entity) do
  -- some code related to the entity
end
```

To get entities in the same region as a point:

`x` (number)
: X coordinate of the region to get.

`y` (number)
: Y coordinate of the region to get.

Return value (function)
: An iterator to all entities in the same region as the point.

To get entities in the same region as another entity:

`entity` (entity)
: An entity.

Return value (function)
: An iterator to all other entities in the same region.

### `map:get_hero()`

Returns the main [hero](./map-entities/hero.md) or the first hero in a multiplayer game.

Return value ([hero](./map-entities/hero.md))
: The main hero.

!!! note "Note"

    Equivalent to `map:get_entity("hero")` but shorter to write. This function is provided for convenience as getting the hero is often needed.

### `map:get_heroes()`

Returns all [hero](./map-entities/hero.md) entities for this map.

Return value (function)
: An iterator to all hero entities in the map.

### `map:set_entities_enabled(prefix, [enabled])`

Enables or disables all [map entities](./map-entities/index.md) having the specified prefix.

Disabled entities are not displayed and are not updated. Therefore, they don't move and their collisions are no longer detected. But they still exist and can be enabled back later.

`prefix` (string)
: Prefix of the entities to change.

`enable` (boolean, optional)

Called when this map starts (when the player enters it).

`destination` ([destination](./map-entities/destination.md))
: The destination entity from where the [hero](./map-entities/hero.md) arrives on the map, or `nil` if he used another way than a destination entity (like the side of the map or direct coordinates).

### `map:on_finished()`

Called when this map stops (when the player leaves it).

### `map:on_update()`

Called at each cycle of the main loop while this map is the current one.

!!! note "Note"

    As this function is called at each cycle, it is recommended to use other solutions when possible, like [timers](./timers.md) and other events.

### `map:on_draw(camera_surface)`

Called when the map has just been redrawn by the engine.

The engine has already drawn the map contents, but not the [menus](./menus.md) of this map if any. Use this event if you want to draw some additional content on the map before the menus, for example an overlay.

`camera_surface` ([surface](./drawable-objects/surface.md))
: The surface of the camera being drawn. This surface represents the visible part of the camera, not the whole map.

!!! note "Note"

    If the map has multiple cameras, this event is called for every camera.

### `map:on_suspended(suspended)`

Called when the map has just been suspended or resumed.

The map is suspended by the engine in a few cases, like when the [game](./game.md) is paused or when a dialog is active. When this happens, all [map entities](./map-entities/index.md) stop moving and most [sprites](./drawable-objects/sprite.md) stop their animation.

`suspended` (boolean)
: `true` if the map was just suspended, `false` if it was resumed.

### `map:on_opening_transition_finished(destination)`

When the map begins, called when the opening transition effect finishes.

: Equipment item being obtained.

`treasure_variant` (number)
: Variant of the treasure (because some [equipment items](./equipment-items.md) may have several variants).

`hero` ([hero](./map-entities/hero.md))
: The hero who is obtaining this treasure.

### `map:on_obtained_treasure(treasure_item, treasure_variant, treasure_savegame_variable, hero)`

Called after the [hero](./map-entities/hero.md) has obtained a treasure on this map.

In the case of a brandished treasure, this event is called once the treasure's dialog is finished. Otherwise, it is called immediately after [`map:on_obtaining_treasure()`](#mapon_obtaining_treasuretreasure_item-treasure_variant-treasure_savegame_variable-hero).

`treasure_item` ([item](./equipment-items.md))
: Equipment item being obtained.

### `map:on_command_pressed(command)`

Called when the player presses a [game command](./game.md#game-commands) (a keyboard key or a joypad action mapped to a built-in game behavior) while this map is active. You can use this event to override the normal built-in behavior of the game command.

`command` (string)
: Name of the built-in game command that was pressed.

    Possible commands are `"action"`, `"attack"`, `"pause"`, `"item_1"`, `"item_2"`, `"right"`, `"up"`, `"left"` and `"down"`

Return value (boolean)
: Indicates whether the event was handled. If you return `true`, the event won't be propagated to other objects (you are overriding the built-in behavior of pressing this game command).

!!! note "Note"

    This event is not triggered if you already handled its underlying low-level keyboard or joypad event.

### `map:on_command_released(command)`

Called when the player released a [game command](./game.md#game-commands) (a keyboard key or a joypad action mapped to a built-in game behavior). while this map is active. You can use this event to override the normal built-in behavior of the game command.

`command` (string)
: Name of the built-in game command that was released.

    Possible commands are `"action"`, `"attack"`, `"pause"`, `"item_1"`, `"item_2"`, `"right"`, `"up"`, `"left"` and `"down"`

Return value (boolean)
: Indicates whether the event was handled. If you return `true`, the event won't be propagated to other objects (you are overriding the built-in behavior of releasing this game command).

!!! note "Note"

    This event is not triggered if you already handled its underlying low-level keyboard or joypad event.

## Events as an Input Handler

In addition to its own events a map is also an input handler and receives all of those events.

The current map is checked after the game and before the hero's state.

See [inputs](./controls/inputs.md) to see all of these events.

## Deprecated methods of the type map

The following methods are deprecated and may be removed it future releases.

### `map:get_camera_position()`

Returns the currently visible area of the map.

!!! warning "Deprecated"

    This method is deprecated because since Solarus 1.5, the [camera](./map-entities/camera.md) is now an entity. Therefore, you can get its coordinates and size like any other entity. Use [`map:get_camera():get_bounding_box()`](./map-entities/index.md#entityget_bounding_box) instead.

### `map:move_camera(x, y, speed, callback, [delay_before], [delay_after])`

Starts a camera moving sequence.

!!! warning "Deprecated"

    This method is deprecated because since Solarus 1.5, the [camera](./map-entities/camera.md) is now an entity. Therefore, you can move the camera like any other entity and have much more customization possibilities. It can be rewritten in pure Lua as follows.

```lua
function map:move_camera(x, y, speed, callback, delay_before, delay_after)

  local camera = map:get_camera()
  local game = map:get_game()
  local hero = map:get_hero()

  delay_before = delay_before or 1000
  delay_after = delay_after or 1000

  local back_x, back_y = camera:get_position_to_track(hero)
  game:set_suspended(true)
  camera:start_manual()

  local movement = sol.movement.create("target")
  movement:set_target(camera:get_position_to_track(x, y))
  movement:set_ignore_obstacles(true)
  movement:set_speed(speed)
  movement:start(camera, function()
    local timer_1 = sol.timer.start(map, delay_before, function()
      callback()
      local timer_2 = sol.timer.start(map, delay_after, function()
        local movement = sol.movement.create("target")
        movement:set_target(back_x, back_y)
        movement:set_ignore_obstacles(true)
        movement:set_speed(speed)
        movement:start(camera, function()
          game:set_suspended(false)
          camera:start_tracking(hero)
          if map.on_camera_back ~= nil then
            map:on_camera_back()
          end
        end)
      end)
      timer_2:set_suspended_with_map(false)
    end)
    timer_1:set_suspended_with_map(false)
  end)
end
```

This function temporarily moves the camera somewhere else, like to a place where a [chest](./map-entities/chest.md) or an [enemy](./map-entities/enemy.md) will appear.

The camera first moves towards a target point. When the target is reached, after a first delay, your callback function is called. Then, after a second delay, the camera moves back towards the hero. The game is suspended during the whole sequence.

`x` (number)
: X coordinate of the target, relative to the map's top-left corner.

`y` (number)
: Y coordinate of the target, relative to the map's top-left corner.

`speed` (number)
: Speed of the camera movement in pixels per second.

`callback` (function)
: A function to be called when the camera reaches the target (after `delay_before`)

`delay_before` (number, optional)
: A delay in milliseconds before calling your function once the target is reached (default `1000`)

`delay_after` (number, optional)
: A delay in milliseconds after calling your function, before the camera goes back (default `1000`)

## Deprecated events of a map

The following events are deprecated and may be removed it future releases.

### `map:on_camera_back()`

After a camera sequence initiated by [`map:move_camera()`](#mapmove_camerax-y-speed-callback-delay_before-delay_after), this event is triggered when the camera gets back to the [hero](./map-entities/hero.md).

!!! warning "Deprecated"

    This event is deprecated because since Solarus 1.5, [`camera:move()`](#mapmove_camerax-y-speed-callback-delay_before-delay_after) is deprecated. The [camera](./map-entities/camera.md) is now an entity and now has much more customization possibilities. Use [`camera:on_state_changed()`](./map-entities/camera.md#cameraon_state_changednew_state_name) instead, or the callback parameter of [`movement:start()`](./movements/index.md#movementstartobject_to_move-callback)
