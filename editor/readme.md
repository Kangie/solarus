```

[Read the detailed instructions](../compilation.md) to build `solarus`

#### macOS

Installing Qt6 on macOS is easy by using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with the following package:

```bash
brew install qt@6
```

#### Linux

On Debian or derivatives, we strongly recommend to use [online installer from Qt](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer-oss) to get the latest version. Following debian packages are not supported on Debian LTS distributions. You can still install them if your Linux distribution provides them in version 6.8 or higher:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends \
  qt6-base-dev \
  qt6-base-dev-tools \
  qt6-tools-dev \
  qt6-tools-dev-tools \
  qt6-l10n-tools \
  libqt6opengl6-dev \
  libqt6svg6-dev
```

#### Windows (MSYS2)

On Windows, using UCTR64 environment, you can install the Qt6 framework with this command:

```bash
pacman --noconfirm --needed -S \
  mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-qt6-base \
  mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-qt6-svg \
  mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-qt6-tools
```

### With Qt Creator

In Qt Creator, you can load the `solarus-editor` project by opening the
`CMakeLists.txt` file.

If Solarus is installed in a standard paths known by CMake, it should directly
work. Otherwise, you need to set CMake variables indicating the location of the
`solarus` includes and libraries. See the example in the command-line section
below.

### With the command line

If you don't want to use Qt Creator, you can build the project from the
command line using CMake.

#### Configure

```bash
cd editor
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

If CMake fails to find Solarus included directories or libraries,
for example because they are not properly installed in the standard paths,
you can explictly indicate their location instead:

```bash
cmake \
  -DSOLARUS_INCLUDE_DIR="/path/to/solarus/include" \
  -DSOLARUS_LIBRARY="/path/to/solarus/libsolarus.so" \
  .. \
```

#### Build

```bash
make
```

#### Run

```bash
./solarus-editor
```
